# Marvel pesquisas de Heroes

Made by Thiago henrique pedro

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.1.
It was development as a show-case of angular and redux (in particular ngRx) capabilities. A lot of improvement can be made either on UI/UX or the code and capabilities of the application.

Every call to the server will end in the main hero-list page. From there we can navigate towards the hero detail page once a hero is selected. Direct navigation to hero-detail is not supported and it will take you to the list of heroes
